Railway offers a generous free tier and is perfect for full-stack applications.

### Prerequisites
1. GitHub account
2. Railway account (free at railway.app)
3. MongoDB Atlas account (free tier)

### Step 1: Prepare MongoDB

2. Create a free cluster
3. Get your connection string
4. Create a database user

### Step 2: Deploy Backend
1. Go to [Railway](https://railway.app)
2. Click "New Project" â†’ "Deploy from GitHub repo"
3. Select your repository
4. Set the root directory to `server/`
5. Add environment variables:
   ```
   MONGODB_URI=your_mongodb_connection_string
   JWT_SECRET=your_jwt_secret_key
   PORT=5000
   ```
6. Deploy

### Step 3: Deploy Frontend
1. In Railway, click "New Service" â†’ "GitHub Repo"
2. Select the same repository
3. Set root directory to `/` (root)
4. Add environment variable:
   ```
   VITE_SERVER_URL=https://your-backend-url.railway.app
   ```
5. Deploy

### Step 4: Configure Domains
